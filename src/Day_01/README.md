# Java Fundamentals Practice - Day 01

This folder contains the first set of Java practice programs as part of my transition plan toward an SDET/QA Automation role. The goal of Day_01 is to strengthen core logic-building skills and input-handling fundamentals that are essential for automation testing in Selenium, API testing, and framework development.

**Summary**

- Day_01 focused on core Java fundamentals and problem-solving.

**Concepts Practiced**

- Basic Java syntax and structure
- Taking user input using Scanner
- Conditional statements (if, else if, else)
- Simple loops
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Data validation logic
- Real-world problem-solving relevant to QA workflows

**Programs Included (10)**

1. Age Validation

- Determines whether a given age is valid for system registration.
- A valid age must be between 18 and 60. 
- Helps build validation logic used in form automation.

2. Temperature Conversion and Safety Check

- Converts a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit and checks if it falls within a safe operational range (10°C to 40°C).
- Useful for practicing mathematical operations and real-world decision logic.

3. Number Comparison

- Accepts two integers and prints which number is larger.
- Strengthens comparison logic similar to assertions used in automation.

4. Divisibility Check

- Checks if a number is even, odd, or divisible by both 2 and 5.
- Good practice for compound conditions and multi-branch decision-making.

5. Marks Validation

- Accepts marks for three subjects and verifies:
- Each subject >= 40
- Overall average >= 50
- This is a multi-condition validation exercise useful for QA-style rule checks.

6. Username Validation

- Validates whether a username is acceptable based on two rules:
- Minimum length of 6 characters
- Must not contain spaces
- This simulates common input validation scenarios in form testing.

7. Sum of Natural Numbers

- Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a loop.
- Reinforces loop fundamentals and incremental calculations.

8. Multiplication Table

- Prints the multiplication table of a given number from 1 to 10.
- Strengthens loop logic and formatted output.

9. Minimum Order Check

- Checks whether the number of cart items meets the minimum requirement (>= 5) to proceed to checkout.
- Models business rule validation often used in e-commerce automation testing.

10. Character Type Identifier

- Identifies whether a given character is:
  - Uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter
  - Digit
  - Special symbol
- Practices ASCII-based decision logic frequently used in input sanitization tests.
